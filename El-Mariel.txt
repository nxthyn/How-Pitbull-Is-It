linesRhymes to the beat of a war drum that criesLike mothers whose sons were sent to fightAnd widows whose spouses souls are all that keep them warm at nightUnderneath spacious skies where stars look more like bulletholesAnd the haze of the clouds more like shroudsI swear I smell gunsmoke, when I inhale too deepCause cheap lies have caused the loss of priceless livesBush is duckin' the truth while the few and the proud dodge landminesNiggas is doin time for gettin caught with a dimeBut he will never be indicted for his crimes against this nationImpatient with waiting it's time we fall in lineAnd stop falling for the liesThe war ain't only in IraqIt's time we fight back, for control of our minds [Intro: Pitbull]Yeah I know y'all listen to my music (Redd Eyezz)But what I'ma do now is try and describe my life to y'all(Pitbull, Pitbull)[Verse 1: Pitbull]Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing itMy life is upside downA gift and a curse that's my life nowThere is no looking or turning backI used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rapI fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils AdvocateConfused but blessed with extravaganceI thank god for all the opportunitiesGiven the opportunity dem boys would put two in me (bla bla bla)We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thievesI made money now I got uncle Sam hustlingMe for a quarter of what I makeHand a quarter

[Interlude: Will Da~Real One]A 1980 exodus of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dreamsA quest to find out what freedom really means at any costBoatloads of Cubans lost in a maze of red tape, and hateEntered this country through the bottom of the United StatesAnd straight, set up shopAs Arthur McDuffy was being beaten to death by four white copsThis world was about to face the musicBetween El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minority AmericansCould no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse itBecause in case y'all haven't noticedWe've gone from the El Mariel BOATLIFTTo the Hurricane Katrina buslift with the same responseWith America standing to help us with one hand on their hipsAnd the other one on her gunsLike 9/11 somehow made us all AmericansBut it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were oneYou see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane KatrinaAnd the Oklahoma BOMBINGS, we all got something in commonAnd that's the desire to enjoy a freedom that cannot be rearranged by fearTo let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live hereSo, TODAY, is 1980 againAnd I'm that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassyHope that when I spit this poem, the whole world will remember meI'm screamin like Sincaid give us us us free, me, Pitbull, and this industryWill Da~Real One, I'm out [Hook]Who runs this here?No, we run this hereWho runs

coming up nextFuck the glitter and the gold and all the glamour and glitsI'm here for one reason and survey says to get richSo give me the loot, show me the cashOpen the safе, show me the stashI suggest that you show you full cool opеrationOr end up in the hospital getting emergency operationsFamily asking, "Doctor, doctor, Will he make it through?"But there's that doctor-doctor can doWhen the ch-ch-ch-choppers are ch-ch-ch-chopping at youThat's it, you're done, you're finished, you're throughThere's no coming back, what you think we're cooking crack?Just one question, dawg, What the fuck are you looking at?I know it's hard, it's hard to understandBut, Pitbull will serve you anyway, even underhandDon't fuck around, because you just might end up under landI'm not a coward, motherfucker, I'm the manI'm a killer on tracks, call me the son of SamI don't know it y'all ready, but bet ya ass I am [Hook]Who runs this here?No, we run this hereWho runs this here?No, we run this

of yourself as a dime rock'Cause you're gonna get smoke as soon as I chokeThe trigger on the nine GlockWhat Pit buys, Pit locks, Pit's why, no, Pit's notBut of course, I'm why, but get this shit rightI'm a little white Cuban that's groovin'More than enough, more than enoughI was put on this Earth to cause chaosI put in this work to enjoy the payoffTruth hurts, but truth is, y'all niggas have been laid offUnless you're a bitch, don't ride my dickBitch, do me the favor, stay offWho wants what, P to the I, I to the TI don't give a fuck if you're blind when I rhymeY'all niggas gonna see me, eat meBeat me, defeat me, see-see, como lo papoPop ya, and leave, no, everything, stock's attorneyThe inch, no medicine to the 6-4That's heaven sent, I represent, cause the Cubans will representFrom the bottom of the bat handle, when I ch-ch-bang youThis is what I hand you, once you hear that, "Oh, shit"You've been hit like a pit on a lift from the four fifthOh, If your man wanted two, shit, you
