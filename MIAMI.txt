Ricans and Haitian killersAnd Cuban dope dealersAnd these here my niggas, I ride for 'emAnd god dammit I'd die for 'em[Instrumental Outro: DJ Khaled] [Verse 1]He went from a street kid doin regular street thingsStraight to a street kingTakin over the city, block by blockBreaking down bricks, servin them rock by rockHe's everything a young gun wanna grow up to beBut if only these young guns could seeThat murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' usCuz the drug game ain't what it used to beSo look deeper when they paint you a pictureAnd try to sell you a dreamCuz a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiendsThe crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to beNow that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrityIs coppin rocks off the news kids on the blockAt the same time tryna school themBut these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptomsAnd if you know this, you won't skip fameBut you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains powerDon't let your life go sour over power[Chorus] (x2)Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictiveThe more you hustle, the more you get addictedThe longer you hustle, the deeper the addictionIf you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal) [Verse 2]Not only did my father used to deal dopeHe used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm juss' keepin it realNow my father doesn't have shitI don't have shitWe don't have shitCuz he didn't stack shitWith all the money he made, he didn't think for one second to put money awayThat's cuz his mind was clouded with white thoughtsHe's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalkThe only thing I can say I gained from my father isKnowledge of the street gameAnd I hope that y'all follow thisI can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaineBut I can say thisMoney that comes quick, leaves quickAnd y'all better believe thisCuz this I've lived and witnessedCatch a couple of chargesNow you're on the Lord's shit listNow you're forced to do businessUntil this business does you of courseYou can die doin' dope, or dealin dope, either orYou choose the road that you need to followAnd you choose the people that you look up to as role models [Chorus] (x2)Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictiveThe more you hustle, the more you get addictedThe longer you hustle, the deeper the addictionIf you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)[Verse 3]I know about hustler'sBut I won't mention no namesCuz they still got cases pendingAnd some are even, appealing, life in the cageAt least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain ageHustlin's like AIDSAt first your infected with HIV, and then it's full blownOnly difference is, instead of havin' no immune systemYou become immune to the system of havin dough, by dealin blowIt's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slowDirty money attracts, dirty thingsAnd if you plan to deal dope I hope you're ready for the murder gameCuz that's what it bringsI'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, noI'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but yetLike a faucet, I'm tryin' to leakAny foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolkAnd let em' know there's more to life than a G of cokeIf you used to push weight then you relateCuz you already had a taste of, hustler's withdrawal [Chorus] (x2)Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictiveThe more you hustle, the more you get addictedThe longer you hustle, the deeper the addictionIf you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal) Hee's baaacckk!!To rip on this  track, I'll rip any broadI don't care, white or black!Hee's baaacckk!If Pit's on the job, then there's no need to worryDog just hurry up and waitCuz I ain't Going no where anytime soonSick
